    <h1 class="center">Classic Beef Stroganoff</h1>
    <p class="center">
      With its tender chunks of beef coated in a luscious creamy sauce and
      served over a bed of buttery noodles, it’s no wonder Beef Stroganoff is
      such a hit. With all that flavor, you might assume it’s a complicated
      dish, but it’s actually quite the opposite. This from-scratch recipe can
      be made in well under an hour and with only 20 minutes of hands-on time,
      since it’s really all about the simmer. (The key to transforming the beef
      into succulent morsels of mouthwatering meat.) So when you want to impress
      the family but don’t have all day to do it—this one’s a guaranteed hit!
